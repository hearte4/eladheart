          <li><strong>Start at breakfast.</strong> Add eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or a scoop of protein powder to oats or smoothies.</li>
          <li><strong>Lean on lean meats.</strong> Chicken, turkey, fish, and lean beef are easy to meal prep and add to lunches and dinners.</li>
          <li><strong>Use high‑protein snacks.</strong> Greek yogurt, cheese, nuts, edamame, jerky, or a protein bar between meals.</li>
          <li><strong>Add legumes.</strong> Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans in soups, salads, and wraps boost protein and fiber.</li>
          <li><strong>Swap where it’s easy.</strong> Choose higher‑protein bread, pasta, or milk alternatives when you shop.</li>

        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "1.25rem", margin: 0 }}>
          <li><strong>Schedule it.</strong> Put workouts in your calendar like meetings so they’re non‑negotiable.</li>
          <li><strong>Start small.</strong> Even 10–15 minutes of walking, stretching, or bodyweight moves counts. Build from there.</li>
          <li><strong>Mix it up.</strong> Combine cardio (walking, cycling, swimming) with strength (weights, resistance bands, bodyweight) 2–3 times a week.</li>
          <li><strong>Move more in daily life.</strong> Take stairs, walk or cycle for errands, and stand or walk during calls.</li>
          <li><strong>Find what you like.</strong> You’ll stick with dancing, hiking, sports, or classes more than something you dread.</li>
